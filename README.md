# LethalCompany InputUtils

Utilities for creating InputActions and having them be accessible in-game.
InputActions created through this mod are accessible in-game via the keybinds menu added in update v45.

#### For feature requests or issues head over to my [repo](https://github.com/Rune580/LethalCompanyInputUtils)

## General Users
This mod is just a dependency for other mods, it doesn't add content, but it allows mods to add keybinds.
### Recommended Install
Use a Mod manager. I won't provide support if a mod manager wasn't used, a mod manager makes it far easier to debug issues since users can just share a modpack code.

# Developer Quick-Start
*This Api/Mod is still in beta, please keep in mind that stuff may change.*
Feedback is appreciated.

Download the latest release from either the [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils) or the [Releases](https://github.com/Rune580/LethalCompanyInputUtils/releases).
Extract the zip and add a reference to the dll file of the mod in Visual Studio or Rider.

## Initializing Your Binds
* Create a **New Class** for bindings, name it whatever you prefer, this class will contain all the InputActions your mod needs.
    * Make sure it extends `LcInputActions`.
* **Create Properties** for all of the InputActions you want/need

```csharp
public class MyExampleInputClass : LcInputActions 
{
    public InputAction ExplodeKey { get; set; }
    public InputAction AnotherKey { get; set; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For actions to be registered to the API, **Properties MUST use the Attribute `[InputAction(...)]`**
>```csharp
>[InputAction("YourkbmPath", Name = "", GamepadPath = "", KbmInteractions = "", GamepadInteractions = "", ActionID = "", ActionType = InputActionType...)]
>```

### Required Parameters
* `kbmPath`: The default bind for Keyboard and Mouse devices
  
### Optional Parameters
* `Name`: The Displayed text in the game keybinds menu
* `GamepadPath`: The default bind for Gamepad devices
  
* `KbmInteractions`: Sets the interactions of the kbm binding. See [Interactions Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Interactions.html)
* `GamepadInteractions`: Sets the interactions of the gamepad binding. See [Interactions Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Interactions.html)

* `ActionID`: Overrides the generated actionId (Generally you don't want to change this)
* `ActionType`: Determines the behavior with which the action triggers. See [ActionType Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionType.html)

So your Attribute could be written like this:
```csharp
[InputAction("<Keyboard>/minus", Name = "Explode")]
public InputAction ExplodeKey { get; set; }
```
Or with any combination of optional parameters:
```csharp
[InputAction("<Keyboard>/minus", Name = "Explode", GamepadPath = "<Gamepad>/Button North", KbmInteractions = "hold(duration = 5)")]
public InputAction ExplodeKey { get; set; }
```
> [!NOTE]
> In this case above the Hold Interaction is being used. This keybind triggers after being held for *5* seconds. See [Interactions Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Interactions.html)

## Referencing Your Binds
Finally, to use the InputAction you need an instance of this class. Due to how registration works, only 1 instance of this class can exist.
The easiest (opinionated) way to do so would be to have a static instance in your plugin class.
```csharp
[BepInPlugin(...)]
public class MyExamplePlugin : BaseUnityPlugin
{
    internal static MyExampleInputClass InputActionsInstance = new MyExampleInputClass();
}
```
You could also opt for having the instance in the InputActions class.
```csharp
public class MyExamplePlugin : LcInputActions 
{
    public static MyExampleInputClass Instance = new();

    [InputAction("explodekey", "<Keyboard>/j", "<Gamepad>/Button North", Name = "Explode")]
    public InputAction ExplodeKey { get; set; }
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### But How Do I Get My Binds String?
> You may have noticed that `<keyboard>/yourKey` can be a little confusing for the special buttons. So try this:
> 1. First, arbitarily set the value to some regular value or just an empty string
> 2. Then, load up your mod and change the keybind to the desired key
> 3. After, look in your `.../BepInEx/controls/YOURMODID.json` file
> 4. Find the `{"action":"myaction","origPath":"","path":"<Keyboard>/f8"}]}`
> 5. Last, copy that `path:""` from the far right i.e. `"<Keyboard>/f8"`

## Using Your Binds
You could then simply reference the instance anywhere you need to have your actions at.
```csharp
public class MyOtherClassOrMonoBehavior
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        MyExamplePlugin.InputActionsInstance.ExplodeKey ...
    }
}
```
or
```csharp
public class MyOtherClassOrMonoBehavior
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        MyExampleInputClass.Instance.ExplodeKey ...
    }
}
```

### The best way to implement this would be using callback contexts with `.performed`
```csharp
public class MyOtherClassOrMonoBehavior
{
    // Name this whatever you like.
    public void SetupKeybindCallbacks()
    {
        MyExamplePlugin.InputActionsInstance.ExplodeKey.performed += OnExplodeKeyPressed
    }

    public void OnExplodeKeyPressed(InputAction.CallbackContext explodeConext)
    {
        if (explodeConext.performed) //Add more checks so your actions only happen when you want the keybind to do something
        {
            // Your executing code here
        }
    }
}
```
Another implementation of this inside of an updating method is getting the boolean value from `.triggered`
```csharp
public class MyOtherClassOrMonoBehavior
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        if (MyExamplePlugin.InputActionsInstance.ExplodeKey.triggered)
        {
            //Your executing code here
        }
    }
}
```
